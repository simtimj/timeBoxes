There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Placeholder: Time Boxes

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  For people that want to keep track of how much time they spend on tasks.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  This product let's you create multiple stopwatches that are able to be saved and resumed. 
  Useful for monitoring the amount of time you put into certain tasks.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  In this hectic and chaotic life, we're constantly multi-tasking to get things done. Yet, if you want to keep track of it all 
  accurately, one timer just won't cut it.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  With it's simple, lightweight, minimalistic design, the product allows the user to create and save multiple timers at once,
  and have them all concisely placed together so it'll only take a glance to know how long it's been since you started any of your timers.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  'Don't let your dreams be dreams. Yesterday you said tomorrow, so just do it.' -Sebastion Ward

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  You just create as many timers as you need, and click start.
  If you want to stop one, simply click the stop button.
  And if you want to empty them all out and start from fresh,
  click the delete all button to start from a fresh slate.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  'I spend many hours in front of a computer monitor, and I've been neglecting taking breaks and resting my eyes.
  With this product I can see how much time it's been since I've last taken a break, another timer is set and resetted
  more frequently for resting my eyes, and the last one shows me how much time I've been focusing on the task at hand.
  The product has made it a lot easier to keep track of all of these types of things.'

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  I hope you enjoy the product, and if there are any suggestions on how to make it even better,
  please email me at juliussimtim@gmail.com.


## Will add
  > Combine button functions to have Start/Stop button.
  > Add option to show or not show milliseconds.
  > Show running "optimal rate" timer on right side.
  > Will be able to show how much time was put into specific timer. 
  > Categorize and show totals later. Totally customizable order and grouping. 
  > Add reduce time option. +5,10,15,20,etc... mins can put custom.
  > Change browser icon in tab.
